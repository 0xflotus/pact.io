# Go

[Pact Go](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/) currently supports Pact Specification v2,
head over to the [website](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/) to get started.

### Go-Kit Example

The Pact Go repository has a detailed [Go Kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) [example](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/tree/master/examples/go-kit)
demonstrating how Pact can be used to test Go Kit microservices.


### Native Go Implementation

There is also a version of Pact for Go (v1.1 compatible) that doesn't require
running a daemon. If you don't need v2+ matching and would prefer to not run a
daemon, consider using / contributing to [Pact Go](https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-go).
