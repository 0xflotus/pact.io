Pact Go is currently in *beta* and supports Pact Specification v2.

Head to the [Go Pact website](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go) to get started using Pact in Golang.

## Go-Kit Example

The Pact Go repository has a detailed [Go Kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) [example](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/tree/master/examples/go-kit)
demonstrating how Pact can be used to test Go Kit microservices.
