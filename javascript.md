# Javascript
[Pact JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js) is currently compliant to Pact Specification Version 2.0 and the release candidate is up!

We also have a [roadmap](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to bring Pact to the most used tools around the Javascript landscape.

Pact JS is currently under active development and are welcoming contributions and feedback. Just [get in touch](http://docs.pact.io/contributing/).

### Other JS tools

#### Pact JS Mocha
An abstraction layer on top of Mocha to remove some of the boilerplate required. The goal of this project is to provide Pact users with a great testing experience while keep using Mocha.

Still under development but an alpha version is available: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-mocha

#### Pact Karma
A Karma plugin that will spin up a Provider Mock Server before your tests run in the browser. Eliminates the need for Ruby in your environment and works seamlessly with Mocha and Jasmine.

Check it out here: https://github.com/pact-foundation/karma-pact

#### Pact Node
A great little tool that wraps the Ruby Provider Mock Server in a Node executable and eliminates the need to manage Ruby versions within your environment. Also enables Provider verification and Pact publishing / tagging.
